* About
  This code is under development in my nightly hours.

  This code is really testing version, there are a lot of hardcoded
  strings.

  I'm using this code for my android development with a lot of other
  tools, so it works but too few functionality. Currently, I'm working
  on porting jde-import-* functions, but not for porting purpose,
  cause I'm curious about how cedet and jde works, that is all.
  
* Details
  The somehow working files is:
  - ede-x-android.el
    
  Others.. better don't look at them.
  
* License
  The same as cedet or emacs, I guess.
